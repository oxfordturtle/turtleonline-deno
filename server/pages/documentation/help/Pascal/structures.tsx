    <h3>Command Structures</h3>
    <p>
      Selection and ordering of commands is done by <em>sequencing</em>,{" "}
      <em>conditional selection</em>, and <em>looping</em>.
    </p>

    <h4>Sequencing of Commands</h4>
    <p>
      Commands to be performed in sequence are usually placed in the appropriate
      order within the program, separated by semicolons, e.g.:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="Pascal">
        colour(green);<br />
        blot(100);<br />
        pause(1000);<br />
        colour(red);<br />
        forward(450);<br />
        &#123;etc.&#125;
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>(From the first example program in the Help menu.)</p>

    <h4>Conditional Selection of Commands</h4>
    <p>
      Suppose you want to draw a blot with a given radius (stored as the integer
      variable <code data-language="Pascal">radius</code>), but only if that
      value is less than 500; do it like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="Pascal">if radius &lt; 500 then blot(radius);</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      If you want to do something different when the condition is not met (e.g.
      drawing a blot with half the radius), extend the{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">if condition then</code> structure by adding{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">else</code> and then the new command:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="Pascal">
        if radius &lt; 500 then blot(radius) else blot(radius / 2);
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Notice that this is a single complex command, so you must not put a
      semicolon before the <code data-language="Pascal">else</code> (if you do,
      Turtle will give you a warning).
    </p>

    <h4>Grouping of Commands</h4>
    <p>
      Sometimes you will want to do a sequence of commands within an{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">
        if &#123;condition&#125; then &#123;command&#125; else
      </code>{" "}
      structure, in which case you can bracket them between{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">begin</code> and{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">end</code>, e.g.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="Pascal">
        if &#123;condition&#125; then<br />
        begin<br />
        &#123;sequence1&#125;<br />
        end<br />
        else<br />
        begin<br />
        &#123;sequence2&#125;<br />
        end;
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Any such bracketed sequence of commands is always treated as a single
      command. (Another possibility is to package them into a procedure.)
    </p>

    <h4>Spacing and Indenting</h4>
    <p>
      Unnecessary ‘white space’ is ignored by Pascal, so you can use line breaks
      and indenting to make the structure of your program easy to read.
    </p>

    <h4>Looping Structures</h4>
    <p>
      Pascal provides three different structures for looping (or ‘iterating’)
      commands. If you know in advance how many times you want to loop â€“ or
      you want to ‘loop over’ a particular range of values (e.g. from 1 to 200),
      then the simplest is a ‘<code data-language="Pascal">for</code> loop’ (or
      ‘counting loop’):
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="Pascal">
        for count := 1 to 200 do<br />
        begin<br />
        forward(count / 3);<br />
        right(5);<br />
        &#123;etc.&#125;<br />
        end;
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      (From the first <code data-language="Pascal">for</code> loop example
      program in the Help menu.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Again <code data-language="Pascal">begin &#123;commands&#125; end</code>{" "}
      is used to bracket together a number of commands, and indenting is used to
      show the structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a <code data-language="Pascal">for</code> loop, the ‘loop variable’
      (here <code data-language="Pascal">count</code>) is given in turn each of
      the values in the range (here 1, 2, 3, …, 199, 200), and the loop
      instructions are performed each time. So in the example above, a spiral is
      drawn as the Turtle moves forward gradually more and more (as{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">count</code> increases).
    </p>
    <p>
      To count downwards, use <code data-language="Pascal">downto</code> instead
      of <code data-language="Pascal">to</code> (as in the ‘Procedure with
      parameter’ example program.
    </p>
    <p>
      If instead of looping a specific number of times, you want to loop through
      some sequence of commands until some particular condition becomes true,
      then you can use:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="Pascal">
        repeat<br />
        &#123;command1;&#125;<br />
        &#123;command2; (etc.)&#125;<br />
        until &#123;condition&#125;
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      The ‘Simple procedure’ example program does this, looping until the Turtle
      is pointing directly north (i.e.,{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">turtd = 0</code>). Alternatively, you can
      loop through a sequence of commands while some condition is true (so that
      it stops when the condition becomes false):
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code data-language="Pascal">
        while &#123;condition&#125; do<br />
        begin<br />
        &#123;sequence of commands&#125;<br />
        end;
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Things that can be done with a ‘<code data-language="Pascal">repeat</code>{" "}
      loop’ can equally be done with a ‘
      <code data-language="Pascal">while</code> loop’ (and vice-versa), but
      sometimes one is more natural than the other. Notice also that a{" "}
      <code data-language="Pascal">repeat</code> loop always executes the
      sequence of commands at least once, because it tests the condition at the
      end of the loop. But a <code data-language="Pascal">while</code> loop
      tests the condition <em>before</em> executing the sequence of commands,
      and so will not execute them even once if condition is false to start
      with. (For examples of the various loops, see the second set of example
      programs, ‘Further commands and structures’.)
